## Project Overview

The primary goal of Secure Face Connect is to deliver precise and streamlined capabilities for detecting and recognizing faces. The system ensures security and accountability through activity logging and role-based access controls (RBAC).

The system is designed for various use cases, including real-time face recognition in conferences and events, where user authentication is critical.

## Features

- **Image Processing**: Supports common image formats (JPEG, PNG) for face detection.
- **Face Detection & Feature Extraction**: Real-time detection of faces from images and live video streams with high accuracy.
- **Face Recognition**: Matches detected faces against a database of known individuals and provides authentication.
- **Database Management**: Admins can easily manage user profiles, including adding or removing facial data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Web-based UI for easy administration of users and system configurations.
- **Logging & Reporting**: Detailed logs of recognition attempts for auditing and accountability.
